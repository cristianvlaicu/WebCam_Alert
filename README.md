# What is this app?
With this app we can activate the webcam when someone is in focus and when it happens it will email us with a capture attached of that "subject" that was captured on webcam.

Note: If you want to use or to try this proyect, please open the emailing script and modify the data from password, sender and reciever. Those data you can see there are my "personal data" and it 
would not work cause I have located my personal password in a system file location. To can use your data from gmail, you can go to your gmail account manager, activate dual verification and when it's 
done, you can set a unique password for this aplication, emailing. 

Both scrits, main and emailing were formatted with BLACK.
